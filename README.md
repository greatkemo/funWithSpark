# funWithSpark üöÄ‚ú®

> A fun exploration project for learning Spark on Kubernetes with k3s, Multipass, and Ansible on Apple Silicon Macs!

*ü§ñ This project was crafted with the help of Claude Sonnet 4 with GitHub Copilot - because even AI loves playing with Spark! ‚ö°Ô∏è*

## üéØ What is this?

This is a **fun learning project** that demonstrates how to:
- Spin up a 3-node Kubernetes cluster using **k3s** and **Multipass** on Mac Studio (Apple Silicon)
- Deploy the **Spark Operator** using Helm
- Run Spark applications on Kubernetes
- Automate everything with **Ansible** and **Make**
- Use **VS Code** for a great developer experience

**Disclaimer**: This is a playground for experimenting and learning! Not intended for production use. üòÑ

## üèóÔ∏è What You Get

- **3-node k3s cluster** running on Ubuntu 24.04 ARM64 VMs
- **Spark Operator** deployed and configured
- **Automated provisioning** with Ansible playbooks
- **One-command setup** with Makefile targets
- **VS Code integration** with tasks and recommended extensions
- **ARM64 compatible** everything (perfect for Apple Silicon Macs)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites (on macOS)
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install multipass ansible kubectl helm
```

### One-Command Demo
```bash
make demo
```

This magical command will:
1. üñ•Ô∏è Create 3 Ubuntu 24.04 VMs via Multipass
2. üîë Configure passwordless SSH access
3. ‚öôÔ∏è Deploy k3s cluster via Ansible (1 master + 2 workers)
4. üìã Fetch and configure kubeconfig
5. üé° Install Spark Operator with Helm
6. ‚ú® Submit a Spark Pi calculation job
7. üìä Stream the logs

## üéÆ Available Commands

```bash
make vms          # Create VMs with Multipass
make ssh          # Setup SSH keys
make k3s          # Deploy k3s cluster
make kubeconfig   # Get cluster access
make helm         # Install Spark Operator
make submit       # Submit Spark Pi job
make logs         # Watch Spark logs
make status       # Check cluster health
make test         # Run Spark functionality tests
make destroy      # Clean up everything
```

## üéØ VS Code Integration

Open in VS Code and enjoy:
- **Recommended extensions** auto-install
- **Tasks** available via Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P` ‚Üí "Tasks: Run Task")
- **Integrated terminal** with all commands ready
- **YAML/Ansible syntax highlighting**

## üß™ Testing Your Setup

```bash
# Quick health check
make status

# Run functionality tests  
make test

# Check individual components
kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config-k3s get nodes
kubectl --kubeconfig=~/.kube/config-k3s get pods -n spark-operator
```

## üéâ What's Working

- ‚úÖ **Infrastructure**: 3-node k3s cluster on ARM64
- ‚úÖ **Networking**: All nodes communicating
- ‚úÖ **Spark Operator**: Deployed and functional
- ‚úÖ **RBAC**: Properly configured permissions
- ‚úÖ **Container Runtime**: containerd working
- ‚úÖ **Automation**: Full pipeline automated

## ü§î Known Quirks

- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ivy Configuration**: Spark Shell has some dependency resolution issues in containerized environment
- üí° **Workaround**: Use pre-compiled Spark applications or different images
- üîß **Resource Tuning**: May need adjustment for smaller VMs

## üßπ Cleanup

```bash
# Clean up test resources
make clean-tests

# Full teardown (removes VMs)
make destroy
```

## üéì What You'll Learn

- **Kubernetes orchestration** with k3s
- **Infrastructure as Code** with Ansible
- **Container orchestration** concepts
- **Spark on Kubernetes** deployment patterns
- **Development workflow** automation
- **ARM64 compatibility** considerations
